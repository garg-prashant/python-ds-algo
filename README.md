# Python DS Algo

Welcome to the Python DS Algo project! This project offers a comprehensive collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. It is designed to help you understand and apply various concepts in computer science efficiently.

## Setup Instructions

To set up this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-ds-algo.git
   cd python-ds-algo
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup Pre-commit Hooks:**
   To ensure code quality, set up pre-commit hooks by running:
   ```bash
   python setup_precommit.py
   ```

## Data Structures

This project includes various data structures implemented in Python. You can explore the source code for each of them:

- [Binary Search Tree](data_structure/tree/binary_search_tree.py): An implementation of an unbalanced binary search tree with operations like insertion, searching, and removal.
- [Simple Graph](data_structure/graphs/simple_graph.py): An implementation of an undirected graph using an adjacency list.

## Algorithms

This project also features several algorithms implemented in Python. You can explore the source code for each of them:

- [Top K Elements](algorithms/tok_k_elements.py): Functions to find the k largest and k smallest elements in an array, and to search in a heap.
- [Fibonacci](algorithms/fibonacci.py): Functions to calculate the nth Fibonacci number using simple recursion, recursion with memoization, top-down dynamic programming, and space efficient dynamic programming.
